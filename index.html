            Kargil War of 1999This day marks the successful conclusion of the conflict between India and Pakistan, which started in May 1999, with
            Indian forces reclaiming strategic positions in the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir that had been infiltrated by
            Pakistani soldiers and terrorists.Kargil Vijay Diwas is a solemn occasion to honour the ultimate sacrifice made by Indian soldiers during the 1999
            conflict. The battles fought in the challenging terrain of Jammu and Kashmir saw 527 Indian soldiers lose their lives.
            Despite the difficult conditions, the Indian Army displayed extraordinary bravery and successfully reclaimed the
            occupied positions, forcing the Pakistani forces to withdraw.

            It is celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm across the country, serving as a tribute to the fortitude and
            heroism of the Indian armed forces.</p>
